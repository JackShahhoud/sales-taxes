## Sales Taxes
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medicalproducts that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales taxapplicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
When I purchase itemsI receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax),finishing with the total cost of the items,and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a taxrate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount ofsales tax.
